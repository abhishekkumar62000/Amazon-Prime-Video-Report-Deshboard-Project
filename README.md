# 🚀 Amazon Prime Video Report Dashboard Project 🎬📊

Welcome to my **Amazon Prime Video Report Dashboard Project**! In this project, I tackled raw, messy data and turned it into powerful, insightful visual reports using a mix of **Excel**, **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**. Here's the breakdown of how I made this happen:

## 🌟 Project Overview:
- **Goal:** Transform raw, unstructured data into an insightful and interactive dashboard.
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Excel 📈  
  - Python 🐍  
  - SQL 💾  
  - Power BI 🔥

## 🔧 How I Built It:
### 1. **Data Gathering 📥**
- Collected raw Amazon Prime Video dataset containing details like movie genres, ratings, release dates, and viewer data.
  
### 2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation 🧹**
- Used **Excel** for initial data cleaning, fixing missing values, and formatting. ✨  
- Performed data wrangling with **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) to remove duplicates, fix inconsistencies, and prepare the data for analysis.

### 3. **Data Analysis with Python 🧠**
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Python** to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within the data. 📊  
- Built insightful summary statistics to highlight key trends, like top-rated genres and content distribution.

### 4. **SQL for Efficient Data Handling 🔄**
- Applied **SQL** queries to filter, aggregate, and summarize data from large tables. 📑  
- Cleaned and joined datasets into more usable forms for deeper analysis and visualization.

### 5. **Building the Power BI Dashboard 📊**
- Transformed the cleaned and analyzed data into stunning visualizations using **Power BI**. 🔥  
- Created interactive charts, graphs, and tables that allow users to explore data like never before. 🌍
