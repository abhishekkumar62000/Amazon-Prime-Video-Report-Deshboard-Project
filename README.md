Amazon Prime Video App Analysis Dashboard Report  I am excited to announce the completion of a new project focused on developing a comprehensive analysis dashboard for the Amazon Prime Video app using Power BI. This dashboard provides insightful visualizations and key performance metrics to track user engagement, content performance, and subscription trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

Key features of the dashboard include:

User Engagement Metrics: Track user behavior, including viewing patterns, average watch time, and content interactions, to understand audience preferences.

Content Performance Analysis: Evaluate the success of various shows and movies by analyzing metrics such as views, ratings, and completion rates, helping to identify high-performing titles.

Subscription Trends: Monitor subscription growth and churn rates over time, providing insights into user retention and the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.

Interactive Visualizations: Utilize dynamic charts and graphs for easy navigation and real-time data analysis, ensuring that insights are accessible and comprehensible.

This dashboard serves as a powerful tool for identifying trends and opportunities within the Amazon Prime Video ecosystem, ultimately supporting strategic planning and enhancing user experience.
