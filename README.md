Amazon Prime Video App Analysis Dashboard Report  I am excited to announce the completion of a new project focused on developing a comprehensive analysis dashboard for the Amazon Prime Video app using Power BI. This dashboard provides insightful visualizations and key performance metrics to track user engagement, content performance, and subscription trends, enabling data-driven decision-making for stakeholders.

Key features of the dashboard include:

User Engagement Metrics: Track user behavior, including viewing patterns, average watch time, and content interactions, to understand audience preferences.

Content Performance Analysis: Evaluate the success of various shows and movies by analyzing metrics such as views, ratings, and completion rates, helping to identify high-performing titles.
